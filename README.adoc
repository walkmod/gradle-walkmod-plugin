The {doctitle} is the first tool to provide {walkmod-url}[Walkmod] integration with {gradle-url}[Gradle].
This plugin adds two new tasks to allow checking and applying walkmod changes to your projects.

WARNING: this is a preliminary version and still some work must be done.

== Installation
As long as this is a preliminary version, no fixed repository exists. If you wish to test the tool, you'll need to install it locally from sources.
A `install` task is provided to simplify the installation in maven local.
Use the following snippet inside a Gradle build file:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
       mavenCentral()
       jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.walkmod:gradle-walkmod-plugin:{version}'
    }

    walkmod {
      chains = ['pmd']
    }
}

apply plugin: 'walkmod'
----

== Usage

The plugin adds a three new tasks:

. `walkmodCheck`: checks for possible changes. Same as using `walkmod check` in the command tool.
. `walkmodApply`: applies changes. Same as using `walkmod apply` in the command tool.
. `walkmodPatch`: generates a patch. Same as using `walkmod patch` in the command tool.


=== Properties
Each tasks provides the following properties for its configuration:

[horizontal]
chains:: chain names to check or apply. Type: List<String>. Default: `empty` (all chains).
offline:: `true` to resolve dependencies (uses {ivy-url}[Ivy]), `false` to resolve locally. Type: `boolean`. Default: `false`.
verbose:: `true` to show extra information. Type: `boolean`. Default: `false`.
showErrors:: `true` to get full details when something goes wrong. Type: `boolean`. Default: `false`.
properties:: dynamic parameters for the execution. Type: String
config:: walkmod configuration file (e.g walkmod.xml). Default: `` (empty).
=== Methods

None right now (this may change in the future).
